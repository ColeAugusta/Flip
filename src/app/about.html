    <h2>About Flip</h2>
    <p>Vision:</p>
    <p>Flip is a project designed to provide an easy to use hand movement tracking software for reading ebooks or pdfs on devices with a camera. Other hand detection software can be unreliable and frustrating to use, so Flip plans to create something that users can consistently trust. Flip will allow for users to “swipe” their hands when pointed at a camera connected to their device, and have the device respond accordingly by swiping to the next page. We plan to package our product in a Chrome extension for free, open source, public use. The project will be created using Python with the OpenCV and NumPy libraries for development of our hand movement tracker, and possibly JavaScript/PyScript for the chrome extension development.</p>
    <p>Semester Goals:</p>
    <p>This semester we have a few measurable goals. We first want to research and become comfortable with the OpenCV and NumPy libraries that Python provides. Utilizing that research, we want to accurately track user hand movement and controls, at minimum for basic hand movements such as swiping left or right. Through this, we want users to be able to seamlessly flip through ebooks/pdfs on their devices. Finally, we want to package whatever capability our movement tracker has into a Chrome Extension for ease of access.</p>
